00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:12,288
Wow

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,824
What an audience

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
But if I'm being honest

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,152
I don't care what you think of my talk

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
I don't

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
I hear the Internet thanks my talk

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,064
Cuz they're the ones who get it seen and get a shirt

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,112
And I think that's where most people get it wrong

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
You're talking to you

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
Here

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,696
Still talking to you

12
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,488
Random person

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
Scrolling Facebook

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
Thanks for the click

15
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:41,216
You see back in 2009 we all have these weird little things called attention span

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
Yeah they're gone they're gone them

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
The debt

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,664
I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED Talk

19
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
Been years literally years

20
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
So if you're given a TED Talk

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
Keep it quick

22
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,088
I'm doing mine and under a minute
