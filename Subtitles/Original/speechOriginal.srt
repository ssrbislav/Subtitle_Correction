1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,912
I wasn't born in this country

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:13,824
I didn't grow up in any one particular religion I have a mixed-race background

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
And I'm gay

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,760
Growing up I was a Target

5
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
Speaking the right way standing the right way holding your wrist

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
The right way

7
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,560
Every day was a test

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
Underwear a thousand ways to fail a thousand ways to betray yourself

9
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Do not live up to someone else's standard of what was acceptable of what was normal

10
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,176
And when you failed the test which was guaranteed

11
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,760
There was a price to pay
